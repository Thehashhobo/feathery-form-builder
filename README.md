This project is a frontend-focused drag-and-drop form builder developed as part of the Feathery Frontend Coding Challenge. It allows users to visually construct a form by dragging predefined UI elements (e.g., inputs, labels, buttons) from a component tray onto a grid-based layout.

The application is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and bundled via **Vite**, with a focus on clean architecture, fluid UX, and code maintainability.
